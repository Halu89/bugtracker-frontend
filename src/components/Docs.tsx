            This project was built by Corentin Briand as a learning project to
            be able to track team projects, and issues related to those projects
            (kind of like Jira).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can view the source code on{" "}

            The objectives of this project were to learn Typescript, as well as
            learning and practicing with "advanced" React features such as
            custom Hooks, and the useCallback and useContext APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website is coded with Typescript, and uses React and
            react-router-dom for the frontend, jwt for the authentication, and
            Sass for the styles.
          </p>

          <h2>Features</h2>
          <section id="auth">
            <h3>Authentication</h3>
            <p>
              To use this website, you need to create an account by clicking on
              the "Register" button. As it is a learning project, your email
              adress is not used for anything and you can use a dummy adress (It
              still needs to be unique and look like a regular adress).
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, I volontarily have not added password restriction, and
              you're free to use a 1 character password if you want.

            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p>
              Once you login, you get redirected to the projects page, which is
              empty for now. You can create a project by clicking on the aptly
              named button
            </p>
            <h4>Create a project</h4>
            <p>Let's create a new project âœ¨!</p>
            <p>
              Once you clicked on the new project button, you can enter a name
              and a description for your project
            </p>
            <img src={newProject} alt="" className="tutorial-img" />
            <p>
              Click submit, and that's it, you made your first project, and we
              can see it in the projects page ðŸŽˆðŸŽˆ.
            </p>
            <img src={firstProject} alt="" className="tutorial-img" />
            <p>
              For now, you are the only contributor and there isn't any issues
              associated with that project
            </p>
            <h4>Edit a project</h4>
            <p>
              Woops, we only want 1 exclamation mark in the description. Let's
              change the project by clicking on the green edit button
            </p>
            <p>
              There, we can edit our project title, description, and see a list
              of all the project members and admins, as well as add or remove
              users from our project.

              The authentication is handled with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). On
              login, the user informations are sent to the server wich verify
              the credentials and returns a signed JWT. The token is then added
              to the Local Storage, and added to every subsequent requests. The
              server verifies that the token is there and hasn't been tampered
              with.
